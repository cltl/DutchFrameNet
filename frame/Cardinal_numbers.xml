<frame xmlns="http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" cBy="MJE" cDate="08/27/2001 05:47:59 PDT Mon" name="Cardinal_numbers" ID="218" xsi:schemaLocation="../schema/frame.xsd">
  <definition>&lt;def-root&gt;This frame presents a situation where there is a certain &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; of instances of an &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; or a certain &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; that quantifies a &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;. Numbers are used to count any kind of &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;s whose own function is to quantify some property, with the &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt;s of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;s. A countable &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt;, and each instance of the &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; it is described as.   &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;s (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;s rather than &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt;s, describe situations with less than a whole &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;or &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; (half.n), or the lack of a &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt; or &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; (zero.num).
&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
There is also a &lt;fen&gt;Precision&lt;/fen&gt; associated with the &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt;. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their &lt;fen&gt;Precision&lt;/fen&gt;, with phrases like "about", etc. 

&lt;ex&gt;Only &lt;fex name="Number"&gt;&lt;t&gt;two&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;senators&lt;/fex&gt; voted in support of the president .&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;Dr. Malik has confined &lt;fex name="Precision"&gt;almost&lt;/fex&gt; a &lt;fex name="Num"&gt;&lt;t&gt;score&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;of such unfortunates&lt;/fex&gt; in his basement, you know.&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;We endured &lt;fex name="Number"&gt;&lt;t&gt;forty&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;days of snow&lt;/fex&gt; .&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;There were &lt;t&gt;&lt;fex name="Num"&gt;thirty&lt;/fex&gt;&lt;/t&gt; &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;of the little blue creatures&lt;/fex&gt; staring up at him.&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had &lt;fex name="Number"&gt;&lt;t&gt;ten&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt;! &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;DNI&lt;/fex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;The ship was &lt;fex name="Number"&gt;&lt;t&gt;three&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Unit"&gt;degrees&lt;/fex&gt; off course .&lt;/ex&gt;

&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; may itself be quantified by having a certain &lt;fen&gt;Multiplier&lt;/fen&gt;, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a &lt;fen&gt;Composite_number&lt;/fen&gt; representing a &lt;fen&gt;Number&lt;/fen&gt; that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; or &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;.

&lt;ex&gt;Stephen has more than &lt;fex name="mul"&gt;five&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;t&gt;&lt;fex name="Number"&gt;hundred&lt;/fex&gt;&lt;/t&gt; in his closet! &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;DNI&lt;/fex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a &lt;fen&gt;Multiplier&lt;/fen&gt;, we consider the number it is modifying to be a &lt;fen&gt;Unit&lt;/fen&gt;:

&lt;ex&gt;There are just over &lt;fex name="Number"&gt;&lt;t&gt;six&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Unit"&gt;billion&lt;/fex&gt; people in the world today.&lt;/ex&gt;
&lt;ex&gt;There are &lt;fex name="deg"&gt;just over&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;fex name="Multiplier"&gt;six&lt;/fex&gt; &lt;t&gt;&lt;fex name="Num"&gt;billion&lt;/fex&gt;&lt;/t&gt; &lt;fex name="Entity"&gt;people&lt;/fex&gt; in the world today.&lt;/ex&gt;

The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num).
&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;
Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping &lt;t&gt;three&lt;/t&gt; singers showed up")

&lt;ex&gt;&lt;/ex&gt;

Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of &lt;fen&gt;Entity&lt;/fen&gt; is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

In the case where a number is modified by a &lt;fen&gt;Multiplier&lt;/fen&gt;, we have found it more plausible that phrases expressing &lt;fen&gt;Precision&lt;/fen&gt; modify the main number (thus "million" in the first example, not "two"):
&lt;ex&gt;JP has &lt;fex name="Precision"&gt;almost&lt;/fex&gt; two &lt;t&gt;million&lt;/t&gt; dollars.&lt;/ex&gt;
